# Huginn

> Agent-pilotable fleet management for Linux VMs — a central hub, lightweight Go
> workers, a web dashboard, and an MCP façade so an AI agent can drive the fleet.

Huginn lets you manage a fleet of Linux VMs from one place: enroll machines with a
one-line installer, approve them from a dashboard, run controlled actions (or
opt-in unrestricted commands), keep workers up to date, and audit everything. An
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposes the same capabilities to an
external AI agent (e.g. "Hermes") without duplicating any business logic.

> **Status:** hub + Go worker + MCP + React dashboard, with docker-compose and
> Kubernetes manifests for the hub. This is a remote command-execution system —
> read [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) before exposing it.

```

- **Hub** (`/hub`) — FastAPI + PostgreSQL. The source of truth: inventory,
  enrollment, authz, audit, the target worker version, and task routing.
- **Worker** (`/worker`) — a single static Go binary installed natively on each VM
  via systemd. It long-polls the hub for tasks (NAT-friendly), runs them locally,
  and reports results. No runtime dependencies.
- **MCP server** (`/mcp`) — a thin façade over the hub's REST API exposing tools
  for an external agent. No direct worker access, no duplicated logic.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — a React SPA (Vite + TypeScript) with a
  distinctive "raven control-console" UI: a home overview, fleet roster, per-node
  actions/updates/unrestricted shell, custom tags/groups, scheduled commands,
  enrollment + MCP tokens, user management, and the audit log with hash-chain
  verification. Served same-origin behind the reverse proxy (no baked hub URL).

By default the worker **pulls** work from the hub over a single outbound HTTPS
connection, so it works behind NAT. A push listener can be enabled per-VM when the
machine is directly routable.

## Authentication

Multiple sign-in methods, all feeding the same admin / operator / read-only RBAC:

- **Local** password (Argon2id), **LDAP/LDAPS**, and **OIDC/SSO** (tested with
  Authentik).
- **Two-factor**: TOTP authenticator apps (with single-use backup codes) and
  **WebAuthn passkeys** for phishing-resistant passwordless login. 2FA can be
  required for admins.
- **SSO-first**: when OIDC is enabled the password form is hidden by default and
  re-enabled only via an explicit "unsafe" flag — never locking you out when OIDC
  is off. See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md).

## Deployment

There are **two compose files** in `deploy/`, and *which one you run* is what
makes it dev or prod — there is no "mode" flag:

| Stack | Command (run from `deploy/`) | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Local / dev** | `docker compose up --build` | ports exposed directly — hub `:8000`, dashboard `:5173`, MCP `:9000`. **No Caddy, no TLS.** |
| **Production** | `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build` | **Caddy** in front, **HTTPS** on 80/443, everything under one domain. |
| **Kubernetes** | `kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/…` (see below) | hub / MCP / dashboard + migration Job + ingress. |

> ⚠️ A plain `docker compose up` (no `-f`) always uses the default
> `docker-compose.yml` → the **dev** stack (direct ports, no Caddy). For
> production you **must** pass `-f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod`.

Each stack reads its **own** env file in `deploy/` (gitignored — copy the
matching `*.example`): dev → `.env`, prod → `.env.prod`.

### Prerequisites

The hub, MCP, and dashboard build **inside Docker** — you do **not** need Python,
Node, etc. on the host. Only `build-artifacts.sh` (which cross-compiles the worker
binaries the hub serves) needs `make` + Go on the host.

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2 git make golang-go openssl
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"      # then re-login, so `docker` needs no sudo
```

| Tool | Needed for |
|---|---|
| Docker + the `docker compose` v2 plugin | running every stack |
| `git` | cloning the repo |
| `make` + **Go ≥ 1.24** | `build-artifacts.sh` only (worker binaries) |
| `openssl` | generating secrets (`openssl rand -hex 32`) |

> If your distro's `golang-go` is older than 1.24, install Go from
> [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) — `make release` needs ≥ 1.24. (You can skip
> Go/`make` entirely if you point workers at prebuilt GitHub-release binaries
> instead of self-hosting them — see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).)

### Local / dev (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunderrrr/Huginn.git
cd Huginn/deploy
cp .env.example .env          # dev template — then edit the secrets
docker compose up --build
```

Starts PostgreSQL, the hub (`:8000`), the dashboard (`:5173`), and the MCP server
(`:9000`). A first admin is bootstrapped from `HUGINN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_*`; log in
to the dashboard at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production (Docker + Caddy + automatic HTTPS)

```bash
cd Huginn/deploy
cp .env.prod.example .env.prod        # set HUGINN_DOMAIN + real secrets (openssl rand -hex 32)
./build-artifacts.sh v1.3.0           # build the worker binaries the hub serves at /dist
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build
```

Only Caddy publishes ports (80/443); the dashboard, `/api`, and `/mcp` share one
origin. Open `https://<HUGINN_DOMAIN>/` and sign in (accept the one-time
self-signed-cert warning if you used an IP/LAN with `HUGINN_TLS_INTERNAL=internal`).

### Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl create namespace huginn
kubectl -n huginn apply -f deploy/k8s/secret.example.yaml    # edit real secrets first
kubectl -n huginn apply -f deploy/k8s/migrate-job.yaml       # DB migrations (run on every upgrade)
kubectl -n huginn apply -f deploy/k8s/hub-deployment.yaml -f deploy/k8s/hub-service.yaml \
  -f deploy/k8s/mcp-deployment.yaml -f deploy/k8s/dashboard-deployment.yaml
kubectl -n huginn apply -f deploy/k8s/ingress.example.yaml   # edit host/issuer first
```

Assumes an **external PostgreSQL** (set in the `huginn-secrets` Secret).

Full details, TLS options, and a production checklist:
**[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)**.

### Enroll a VM

After generating an enrollment token (dashboard → Fleet → Add VM, or the API):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://<hub>/install.sh | HUB_URL=https://<hub> TOKEN=<token> bash
# add -k if the hub uses a self-signed/internal cert (see docs/enrollment.md)
```

The hub serves `install.sh` and the worker binaries itself, so this works without
a GitHub release. The VM appears as **PENDING**; approve it before it can receive
any command.

See [docs/](docs/) for [architecture](docs/architecture.md),
[authentication & 2FA](docs/auth.md), [enrollment](docs/enrollment.md),
[security](docs/security.md), [deployment](docs/deployment.md), and
[MCP integration](docs/mcp.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `hub/` | FastAPI hub (Python 3.12+, SQLAlchemy 2 async, Alembic) |
| `worker/` | Go worker daemon (static binary, systemd) |
| `mcp/` | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) — façade over the hub |
| `dashboard/` | React SPA (Vite + TypeScript) |
| `deploy/` | docker-compose + Kubernetes manifests |
| `scripts/` | `install.sh` one-liner installer |
| `docs/` | documentation |

## Security

Auth on every endpoint, optional 2FA (TOTP + WebAuthn passkeys) with TOTP secrets
encrypted at rest, timing-safe secret comparison, TLS enforced for hub↔worker in
prod, secrets hashed at rest, no shell construction on the worker (separated argv,
never `sh -c`), opt-in + audited unrestricted mode, rate limits and body caps on
execution, SSRF allowlist on update sources, and an append-only hash-chained audit
log. Details in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md). Report vulnerabilities per
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
